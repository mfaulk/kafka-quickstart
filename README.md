kafka-quickstart
===========

Quickly deploy a minimal Zookeeper + Kafka setup using Vagrant.

1) Install Vagrant [http://www.vagrantup.com/](http://www.vagrantup.com/)  
2) Install Virtual Box [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  

```
vagrant up
```

Once vagrant finishes, it takes a little longer for Kafka to start. You can `vagrant ssh brokerOne` and `less /opt/apache/kafka/logs/server.log` to see if a leader has been elected. At that point:

* Zookeeper will be running 192.168.86.5
* Broker 1 on 192.168.86.10

You can access the brokers and zookeeper by their IP from your local without having to go into vm.

e.g.

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 192.168.86.10:9092 --topic <get this from the random topic created in test>

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper 192.168.86.5:2181 --topic <get this from the random topic created in test> --from-beginning
